# Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

# Symbol       Value
# I             1
# V             5
# X             10
# L             50
# C             100
# D             500
# M             1000

# For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together.
# 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

# Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII.
# Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four.
# The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

# I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
# X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
# C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

# Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
